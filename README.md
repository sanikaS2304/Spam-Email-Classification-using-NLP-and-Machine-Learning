# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning

Email Spam classification is a Powerful tool that are created using NLP techniques and ML Algorithms to protect you from spam emails.
with an intuitive interface that built on Streamlit, it accurately identifies emails as a spam ensuring clutter free email experience.

<h2>Description</h2>

-**Dataset** - spam.csv is dataset file that contains all the email content labelled as spam and ham(not spam).<br>
-**Data preprocessing** - This is done by using NLP techniques involves removing unnecessary characters, tokenizing the text, converting the text to lowercase, removing stop words, and performing stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.<br>
-**Model Training** - A machine learning algorithm for email classification such as Naive Bayes will be used. Trained the model using the training dataset, where the features are the preprocessed email texts, and the labels are the spam or non-spam categories.<br>
-**Model Evaluation** - Evaluated trained model accuracy will be given approximate 97% which is the proportion of correctly classified samples in the test set.<br>
-**User Interface** - UI built by using streamlit and it accurately identify email as spam or not spam.<br>

<h2>Features</h2>

-**Email Classification** : Enter an email and classify it as Spam or Not Spam. <br>
